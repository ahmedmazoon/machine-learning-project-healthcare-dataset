# Stroke Prediction using Healthcare Dataset

This project uses a healthcare dataset to predict the likelihood of stroke in patients based on various features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, and more. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building a classification model.

## Dataset
[Healthcare Dataset - Stroke Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/godfatherfigure/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data)

## Features
- Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding)
- EDA (age distribution, risk factors)
- Classification model (Logistic Regression / Random Forest)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

## Tools
Python, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
